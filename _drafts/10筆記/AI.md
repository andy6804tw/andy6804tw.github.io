1. Artificial intelligence has developed rapidly in the past ten years.
2. AI is essentially trying to mimic human beings. Think about all the amazing things we do as humans, and that AI is going to do some of those on our behalf.
3. AI learns to do generative work in the same way we do: we read a lot of documents, and assemble reason, deduction and extraction from that reading (AI怎麼學?)

## 2020筆記
1. We're going to see a lot of interesting applications that produce text or audio, but the producer might be the AI.
2. Given what has happened in 2020, we’ll have a lot more video data inputs, and not just text or images.
3. Humanity is plagued by bias, and with machine learning models bias is a similar problem.  (XAI)
4. In AI, bias can happen when all the data points fit in a certain direction, and you have never seen data outside that context.(XAI)
5. if you have bad data bias, you’ll get bad, biased outcomes.
6. Secondly there’s the issue of model drift, where the algorithm is supposed to produce a certain type of result but just starts heading in the wrong direction. (模型學習方向錯誤)
7. 中國在數據搜集上佔有優勢

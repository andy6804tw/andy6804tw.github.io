-----
1. This conference will focus on the discussion of the various aspects of Fuzzy System. I think this will be of great help to our research. 
2. finally, i wish this session a complete success.
-----

It allow our natural human to help us on making decision.

You explain very clearly. It is very helpful for novices who want to learn fuzzy logic.

In machine learning there are many algorithm to optimize your data. same as fuzzy system to find the better param.





## 常用
1. sorry I over run.
2. Thank you for your excellent / interesting lecture, but I would like to raise a question here.
3. I enjoy very much your presentation.

## 結語
Hello every hope you guys doing well. Because of epidemic force eveybody at home. We using remote meeting connect you and me each other. 
I think today was a big success on both High School workshop and Go competition. 
Every teams really did a great job. I'm very impressed for all elementary students. 
All the best to everyone.
I think everyone can give applause. 


STEM education is a new way of learning. 
We developed this system to help students understand artificial intelligence more quickly.
so the AI-FML blockly you can see that this is the first idea combine human decision and real world application.

Furthermore, we add some extension blocks in our blockly, including MQTT and Fuzzy inference blocks.


## Blockly intro
Blockly editor is free and open-source software by Google. so you can use the blockly API library to create your own custom blockly by youself.

## AI-FML blockly intro
AI-FML blockly system typically runs in a web browser, and visually resembles the language Scratch. 

The student can easily build up their own fuzzy controller by blockly. We are still developing this part. 

so now the AI-FML blockly successfully combine the IEEE 1855 standard FML, which means students can upload the fml file in our system. and do some inference using Fuzzy mechanism.

## 問題
In most Fuzzy control case we predict the continue value, which is regression problem.
And I saw your slide, you use GPS to predict something clsss one two three.
I'm curious about how to build up classifier with fuzzy system. 
Can you share any information about How to constuct Fuzzy Classfication in the chat. I'll very appreciate.

Neural network is such a great idea to predict something. like regession and classfication problem. especially in image classifier or object detection
and nature language processing. This is why many people using NN to solve the big data problem.
How many neural and hidden layer I thhink is most difficult.


I'm very impressed by your present. Here I'm two questions. 
The first how about the Fuzzy Logic core in your scratch system. The student need to construct the KB and RB in the case of fans control?

I saw your page 4 you introuce Fuzzy classifier with scratch programing.
I'm curious about how to build up classifier with fuzzy system. 

It’s clear to me now.

using imprecise concepts is great. fuzziness enable construction of human friendly






I just a quickly look on your sharing link. In this mblock simulation tool. You can add your own custom blocks right?
And you can write your own script to mblock.
